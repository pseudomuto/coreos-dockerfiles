# Dockerfiles

A collection of Dockerfiles used for creating images. Each folder represents an image that can be
downloaded from `pseudomuto/[folder_name]` on the [Docker Registry].

To use an image run `sudo docker pull pseudomuto/[folder_name]`, or just build your own from the
_Dockerfile_.

See the README file in each subfolder for details about the image
